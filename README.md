# Metallic-Segregator
Robotic Arm for Segregation of Metallic Components
The execution of pick and place operations on objects is facilitated by this device, which has been engineered to incorporate object classification. 
The fabrication of the robotic arm is achieved through the utilization of customized 3D printing techniques, designed for mobility. 
Object classification is accomplished by employing a TFLite model deployed on a Raspberry Pi 4. 
Additionally, control of the robotic arm is achieved with the utilization of a Raspberry Pi Pico.
